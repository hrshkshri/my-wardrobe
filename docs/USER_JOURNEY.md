#### I. Stylist as General User

```
Important: Stylists can ALSO use all general user features!

As a stylist, you can:
✓ Create your own wardrobes
✓ Add your clothing items
✓ Build and save outfits
✓ Use the outfit planner
✓ Share with friends
✓ Request styling from OTHER stylists
  (Cannot request from yourself)

Example:
Priya (Stylist) has a date night coming up
  → Clicks "Get Styling Help"
  → Creates request
  → Another stylist (Rahul) accepts
  → Priya receives styling help
  → Pays ₹299 (she's using free sessions as a client)

This way, stylists can:
- Understand the user experience
- Get help for their own fashion needs
- Build empathy with clients
```
